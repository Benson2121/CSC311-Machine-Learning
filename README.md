[Course Website](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~michael/teaching/csc311_w23/)

An introduction to methods for automated learning of relationships on the basis of empirical data. Classification and regression using nearest neighbour methods, decision trees, linear models, and neural networks. Clustering algorithms. Problems of overfitting and of assessing accuracy. Basics of reinforcement learning.

## Course Overview

Machine learning (ML) is a set of techniques that allow computers to learn from data and experience rather than requiring humans to specify the desired behaviour by hand. ML has become increasingly central both in AI as an academic field and industry. This course provides a broad introduction to some of the most commonly used ML algorithms. It also introduces vital algorithmic principles that will serve as a foundation for more advanced courses, such as CSC412/2506 (Probabilistic Learning and Reasoning) and CSC413/2516 (Neural Networks and Deep Learning).

We start with nearest neighbours, the canonical non-parametric model. We then turn to parametric models: linear regression, logistic regression, soft max regression, and neural networks. We then move on to unsupervised learning, focusing in particular on probabilistic models, but also principal components analysis and K-means. Finally, we cover the basics of reinforcement learning. We will develop a mathematical foundation to understand and implement these algorithms.
