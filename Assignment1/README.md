Please refer to the handout.pdf for the full assignment.

## 1. Nearest Neighbours and the Curse of Dimensionality. 

In this question, you will verify the claim from lecture that “most” points in a high-dimensional space are far away from each other, and also approximately the same distance. There is a very neat proof of this fact which uses the properties of expectation and variance.

## 2. Decision Trees.
In this question, you will use the scikit-learn decision tree classifier to classify real vs. fake news headlines. The aim of this question is for you to read the scikit-learn API and get comfortable with training/validation splits.

## 3. Regularized Linear Regression.
In lecture, we saw that regression models with too much capacity can overfit the training data and fail to generalize. We also saw that one way to improve generalization is regularization: adding a term to the cost function which favors some explanations over others.
